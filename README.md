# rust-arenaclient

rust-arenaclient was created for [ai-arena](https://aiarena.net/) to act as a proxy between 
bots and StarCraft II. It was originally written entirely in Python, 
but due to performance concerns, was rewritten using Rust + [pyo3](https://github.com/pyo3/pyo3).

It can be used as a stand-alone binary or as a Python library for convenience.

## Installation
You can install rust_arenaclient using:

```bash
pip install rust_arenaclient
```
or alternatively build a binary from source using 
```bash
cargo build --bin rust_ac_bin
```
## Usage

### Python
```python
from rust_ac import Server

server = Server("127.0.0.1:8642")
server.run()
```
### Binary
Currently the proxy server starts on `127.0.0.1:8642` when launched. Future updates will enable the user to specify 
host and port using command line arguments, after which this README will be updated.

## Running a game
rust_arenaclient was made for the purpose of being part of a bigger system
 to run StarCraft II
games. The system will interact with the rust_arenaclient through websockets and is known
 as a supervisor. rust_arenaclient only acts as a proxy between bots and StarCraft II. 
 The starting of bots and creating game config 
is the supervisor's job. Example of an extremely basic supervisor script in Python:
```python
import os, subprocess, asyncio, aiohttp
from rust_ac import Server

from rust_ac.match_runner import MatchRunner
from rust_ac import GameConfig


m = MatchRunner(bot_directory=r"D:\desktop backup\aiarenaclient\aiarena-client\aiarena-test-bots")
result = m.run_game(game=GameConfig('AutomatonLE', 'loser_bot', 'MicroMachine'))  # One game

games = [GameConfig('AutomatonLE', 'loser_bot', 'basic_bot') for _ in range(20)]

results = m.run_games_multiple(games=games, instances=3)  # Multiple games - Run 3 games at a time
```

## Logging
Logging is done via the handly [pyo3-log](https://github.com/vorner/pyo3-log) crate. To get the Rust logs in Python, initialize the logging library before importing rust-arenaclient, i.e. 
```python
import os, subprocess, asyncio, aiohttp
import logging # Needs to be imported before importing rust_ac
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG) # Set debugging level
logging.basicConfig(filename="log.txt", level=logging.DEBUG, filemode="w+") # Write logs to a file called "log.txt"
logging.info("") # Needed to initialize logging
from rust_ac import Server

from rust_ac.match_runner import MatchRunner
from rust_ac import GameConfig


m = MatchRunner(bot_directory=r"D:\desktop backup\aiarenaclient\aiarena-client\aiarena-test-bots")
...
```
